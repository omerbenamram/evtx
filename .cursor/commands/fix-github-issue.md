# Important

do NOT respond to the issue with a comment/close it without asking for confirmation first.

Look at the issue - our first goal is to understand if it is a bug or a feature request.

   - If it is a bug, we need to reproduce the issue and then fix it.
       - It must have sufficient information to reproduce the issue, or some link to a sample file we can parse.
       - If it does not have sufficient information, we need to ask the user for more information.
    - If it is a feature request - we need to consider if the feature is reasonable.
        - Users ask a lot of the times for features which could otherwise have been implemented by chaining existing tools, like piping evtx to jq for filtering.
        - Suggest a plan of how to implement the feature, and if it is accepted, implement it.
